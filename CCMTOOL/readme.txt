Version 1

We completed all the requirements related to Sprint 1 of the Complexity mesuring tool. 
complexity of each factors were measured by uploading single Java program to the system.

Version 2.

while completing the requirements relted to Sprint 2 we developed a section to customize 
the factor weights for the user. after uploading the java program user can customize the 
weights intead of using system defautls. after the intergrating of the all completed parts
into single system we deployed the system on Microsoft Azure as a Web App. but after hosting we 
had to face an issue of file uploading and the system that worked in localhost didn't work as it was
after deploying in Azure. finally we removed the file upload section with the action and made
into a Input code(Raw code) insert method.
